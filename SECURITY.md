# Security Policy

This is where you'd put your project's security policy. Be sure to
enable "Private vulnerability reporting" on GitHub within the "Code security and analysis"
section of repository settings and update the below URL to your repository's (owner/name) slug.

## Supported Versions

Only the most-recent version is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities can be disclosed privately by [creating a new security advisory](https://github.com/moshekaplan/google-voice-takeout-parser/security/advisories).
Maintainers will follow up with a fix and coordinate a release within the security advisory.
