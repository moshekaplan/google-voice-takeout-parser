# Security Policy

This is where you'd put your project's security policy. Be sure to
enable "Private vulnerability reporting" on GitHub within the "Code security and analysis"
section of repository settings and update the below URL to your repository's (owner/name) slug.

## Supported Versions

Use this section to inform users about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities can be disclosed privately by [creating a new security advisory](https://github.com/sethmlarson/secure-python-package-template/security/advisories).
Maintainers will follow up with a fix and coordinate a release within the security advisory.
